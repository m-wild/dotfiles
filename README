# posh-rcm

Powershell .rc manager


### What is this?

Allows you to manage your .rc files with git by creating symlinks from a single source-controlled directory to the various locations that the rc files live. While this was originally created for the powershell $PROFILE and .vimrc, it could be used for any .rc file, or any other configuration file for that matter.


### Usage

1. Clone
2. Add `[...]posh-rcm\bin` to your path.
3. See `posh-rcm -Help` for detailed usage instructions.
